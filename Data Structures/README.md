# Linked List Insertions

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list. </br>
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node. </br>
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node. </br>

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O - Time O(n) no matter how many nodes we add the time to execute will be fixed on that input. </br>
BIG O - Space O(1) we have one value assigned to current, no other space is created as part of the method.
