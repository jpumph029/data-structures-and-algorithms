# Stacks and Queues
# Implement a Queue using two Stacks.
Data Structure for more practice with stacks

## Challenge
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement the standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods: </br>

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach. </br>
dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach. </br>

## Approach & Efficiency
Search: Big O Time = O(n), Space = O(n) </br>
Insert/Delete: Big O Time = O(1), Space = O(n)</br>
